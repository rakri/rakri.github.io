<b>Show Unread in Gmail</b>: Here's a cool Gmail tip that I recently found handy. If you would like it to show only the unread emails in a particular folder/label, all you need to do is search for "label:yourlabel label:unread".

<br><br>


<b>Pittsburgh Trivia</b>: If you're in town, check out some of the cool <a href="http://www.communitywalk.com/pittsburgh/pa/pittsburgh_stairs/map/444504">Pittsburgh Steps</a>---the ones on the southside slopes likely come with a great view of the hills, the river(s), and of course, downtown Pittsburgh for free. Walking the long ones up will always be more rewarding :) Plus there are the usual suspects of taking the Incline up Mt. Washington,  Fallingwater, Strip District on a Saturday, North Side Museums, etc.

<b>Thought for Food</b>: (Restaurant choices in Bangalore, with bias towards the veggies).
<br>
Brahmin's Coffee Bar (for the idli+vada), Veena Stores (softest idlis, good vada, sweet pongal), Ganesh Darshan (dosa+coffee).
<br><br>
<b>Coffee!</b> Last but not least, do check out my wife Divya's Indian coffee venture <a href="http://www.madrushcoffee.com">Madrush Coffee</a> if you want fresh Indian coffees shipped across the USA; if you live in India, she's got you covered as well with <a href="http://www.beachvillecoffee.com">Beachville Coffee Roasters</a>. And if you host at Airbnb, check out <a href="http://www.pricelabs.co">Pricelabs</a>, an exciting startup of my undergraduate friend Anurag!

<b>And some credits:</b> for my publications, I used the <a href="https://github.com/pcooksey/bibtex-js">bibtex-js tool</a> which takes in a bibtex and outputs a html page using javascript -- for the specific implementation and template, I used <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/Veloso.html">Manuela Veloso's</a> style, many thanks for that!
