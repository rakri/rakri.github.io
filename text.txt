Dear Mr Ramgopal,

Hope you are well. This is to introduce Mr Venkata Narasimha Raju Vari Pettah from Guntur who is an intustrialist and leading tobacco merchant. He wants to meet you and discuss with you, the various aspects and the current real estate trend in cochin. Mr Venkata Narasimha Raju Vari Pettah is a very rich man worth several thousand crores and he will be coming in his own aircraft to Cochin. Please reserve a suite for him in Malabar and also a suite for his PA, Mr Pettah Vari Raju Narasimha Venkata. Both will bring two donkeys with them as security in the aircraft. Please reserve one more suite for the donkeys. I am sure you will take care of them and give the best service and support for their investment in Cochin.

Yours,
Ramgopal
